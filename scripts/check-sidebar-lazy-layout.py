"""Regression guard for the workspace-sidebar lazy-layout contract.

The workspace sidebar renders its rows as a `LazyVStack` inside a vertical
`ScrollView`. Keeping that stack lazy at *measure time* is load-bearing: the
sidebar is re-diffed on every workspace/telemetry update, so any code that
forces SwiftUI to realize and measure the whole row list on each layout pass
turns a routine update into a multi-second `GraphHost.flushTransactions()`
main-thread livelock once enough workspaces/surfaces are open.

This exact class of bug has regressed four times:

  * #2586  GeometryReader + PreferenceKey -> @State height feedback loop
  * #5764  per-row String id allocation in the ForEach diff
  * #5845  same livelock family, reintroduced
  * #6033 -> #6210  `SidebarRowsFillLayout`, a custom `Layout` that called
           `subview.sizeThatFits(ProposedViewSize(width:, height: nil))` on the
           `LazyVStack` in both `sizeThatFits` and `placeSubviews`, realizing
           every row each pass. Removed in #6188.

  * #6384  the user-reported ~1s beachball that #6188 fixed.

Until now the contract was defended only by inline comments, which CI cannot
enforce. This guard scans the two functions that define the sidebar's
steady-state scroll layout in `Sources/ContentView.swift`
(`workspaceScrollContent` and `workspaceRows`) and fails if either:

  1. reintroduces a whole-list measurement signature
     (`GeometryReader`, `ProposedViewSize(... nil ...)`, `.sizeThatFits(`, the
     deleted `SidebarRowsFillLayout`, or ANY custom `Layout`-conforming type
     discovered in the codebase being applied to the rows -- so renaming the
     force-measuring layout does not dodge the guard), or
  2. drops one of the lazy-fill primitives the fix relies on
     (`LazyVStack(` in `workspaceRows`, `.frame(minHeight:` in
     `workspaceScrollContent`).

Comments and string literals are neutralized before scanning, so the historical
explanatory comments in those functions (which deliberately name the very
anti-patterns this guard forbids) do not trip it.

The drag-only drop-target reader (`rowsWithGatedDropTargetReader`) is *not*
scanned: it intentionally uses a `GeometryReader` to resolve per-row drop
anchors and is gated behind an active drag (#5325), so it never runs during the
steady-state layout this guard protects.

Scope: the guard protects the rows layout *as expressed in*
`workspaceScrollContent` / `workspaceRows`. It deliberately does not chase a
force-measure that a future refactor relocates into some other
transitively-called helper function: tracking arbitrary call graphs in a
source-pattern lint is fragile, and extracting the rows layout into a new helper
is a large enough change that it should re-review this guard directly (the
"could not locate function" failure already trips on the most common such
rename). Custom `Layout` types are the exception that *is* chased across files,
because a renamed force-measuring layout is the concrete historical regression
(#6033).

Usage:
    scripts/check-sidebar-lazy-layout.py [--file PATH]

Exit codes:
    0  the scanned file satisfies the lazy-layout contract
    1  an anti-pattern was found, a required primitive is missing, or one of the
       guarded functions could not be located (treated as a failure so the guard
       cannot silently rot into a no-op when the code is renamed).
